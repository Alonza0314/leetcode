# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

## Intuition

The problem requires us to remove duplicate letters from a string while maintaining the lexicographically smallest possible result. We need to ensure that:

1. Each character appears only once in the result
2. The relative order of characters is preserved
3. The result is lexicographically smallest among all possible results

## Approach

1. First, we create a map `lastSeen` to record the last occurrence of each character in the string
2. We use a stack (`st`) to build our result and a set (`seen`) to track characters we've already included
3. For each character in the string:
    - If we haven't seen it before, we try to add it to our result
    - Before adding, we check if we can remove characters from the stack that are:
        - Greater than the current character (to maintain lexicographical order)
        - Will appear again later in the string (using lastSeen map)
4. Finally, we convert the stack to a string and return it

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## Keywords

- Stack
- Greedy
- String
- Hash Map
- Lexicographical Order

## Code

```go
func removeDuplicateLetters(s string) string {
    lastSeen := make(map[rune]int)
    for i, c := range s {
        lastSeen[c] = i
    }

    st, seen := make([]rune, 0), make(map[rune]bool)
    for i, c := range s {
        if !seen[c] {
            for len(st) > 0 && c < st[len(st) - 1] && i < lastSeen[st[len(st) - 1]] {
                delete(seen, st[len(st) - 1])
                st = st[: len(st) - 1]
            }
            seen[c], st = true, append(st, c)
        }
    }

    return string(st)
}
```
